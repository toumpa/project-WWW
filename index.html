                William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor.
                He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent
                dramatist.
                He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including
                collaborations,
                consist of some 39 plays,154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of
                uncertain
                authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often
                than
                those of any other playwright. He remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language,
                and his
                works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
                Warwickshire.
                At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet
                and Judith.
                Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
                part-owner of a playing
                company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he
                appears to have retired
                to Stratford, where he died three years later. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and
                are regarded as
                some of the best works produced in these genres. </p>

                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker)
                    originally from Snitterfield in
                    Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in
                    Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was
                    baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April,
                    Saint George's Day. This date,
                    which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers
                    because Shakespeare died on the same
                    date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son. Although no
                    attendance records for the period survive,
                    most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,
                    a free school chartered in 1553,
                    about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. </p>
                <p>At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese
                    of Worcester issued a marriage
                    licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing
                    that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.
                    And six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.
                    Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith,
                    followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at
                    the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596. </p>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records
                    of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. In 1599, a
                    partnership of members of the company built their own
                    theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership
                    also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre.
                    Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association
                    with the company made him a wealthy man, and
                    in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a
                    share of the parish tithes in Stratford. </p>

                </p>
                <p>Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a
                    document which he begins by describing himself
                    as being in "perfect health". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a
                    century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford,
                    wrote in his notebook: "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems,
                    drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there
                    contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes
                    from fellow authors, one refers to his
                    relatively sudden death: "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's
                    stage to the grave's tiring room." </p>

                Shakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their
                folio classification as comedies, histories,
                and tragedies. Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of
                Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon,
                with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No
                Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio. </p>
                <p> In the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though
                    many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies,
                    Dowden's term is often used. In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term "problem plays" to describe
                    four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure,
                    Troilus and Cressida, and Hamlet. "Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called
                    comedies or tragedies", he wrote. "We may, therefore, borrow
                    a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem
                    plays."The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays,
                    remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.</p>

                    </ul>
                In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative
                poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and
                The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis,
                an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances
                of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.
                Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems
                show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were
                often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime.
                A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a
                persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition
                of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics
                consider that its fine qualities are marred by
                leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the
                deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover,
                the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate
                Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but
                without his permission.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <h1>
                            <li>Sonnets:</li>
                        </h1>
                    </ul>
                Published in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars
                are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets
                was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private
                readership. Even before the two unauthorised
                sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's
                "sugred Sonnets among his private friends".
                Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence. He seems to
                have planned two contrasting series: one
                about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about
                conflicted love for a fair young man (the "fair
                youth"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial "I" who
                addresses them represents Shakespeare himself,
                though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets "Shakespeare unlocked his heart".</p>
                <p>The 1609 edition was dedicated to a "Mr. W.H.", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems. It is
                    not known whether this was written by
                    Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the
                    dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was,
                    despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.Critics praise the
                    Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature
                    of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.</p>
